Prototype implementation of https://github.com/brillout/FasterWeb/blob/master/UntrustedSharedCache.md which is part of https://github.com/brillout/FasterWeb.


***********************************
### Edit / Notice
This implementation is currently on hold because of the analysis done after inspecting the amount of duplication in the browser's cache, see https://github.com/brillout/inspect-browser-cache-duplication.
For now the proposed _Untrusted Shared Cache_ solution is probably not worth the effort but this will likely change in the future.
